trying to make Japanese IME more comfortable to use

### Explanation
The idea behind this is simple - we're using a shortcut for Japanese
and then "pressing" a button that works as a Kana button
which is present on Japanese keyboards (so you don't have to buy one).
Thus, it is always one button press to Hiragana from any selected layout, be it English or any other.

I used F1-F3 and Capslock since they are fairly useless to me.
You can use any keys/combination you like, just replace mine with yours in the script.

### How to use
You can either install AutoHotKey and use a script (.ahk) to compile your own EXE file (RMB > Compile)
or just use my EXE if you are brave enough >:3

To make it run with Windows you can create a shortcut and drop it in your Startup folder, this is what I did.

### Tips
To set up language shortcuts you can use the guide from [here](https://www.itechtics.com/change-keyboard-layout-shortcuts/).

To prevent Windows from resetting your language shortcuts I *highly recommend* to apply the solution from [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1134099/windows-10-language-bar-hot-keys-are-reseted-to-none-after-locking).

### Compatibility
Works on Windows 10 with both Microsoft and Google IME, should work on other systems too.
