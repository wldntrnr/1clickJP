trying to make Japanese IME more comfortable to use

### Explanation
The idea behind this is simple - we're using a shortcut for Japanese (Shift+Ctrl+1, need to be set in Windows)
and then "pressing" a button that works as a Kana button
which is located somewhere on Japanese keyboards (idk I don't have one).
Thus, it is always one button press to Hiragana from any selected layout, be it English or any other.

I used a Capslock button since it is fairly useless to me.
You can use any keys/combination you like, just replace mine with yours in the script.

### How to use
You can either install AutoHotKey and use a script (.ahk) to compile your own EXE file (RMB > Compile)
or just use my EXE if you are brave enough >:3

To make it run with Windows you can create a shortcut and drop it in your Startup folder, this is what I did.

### Tips
[How to set up the language shortcuts](https://www.itechtics.com/change-keyboard-layout-shortcuts/).

To prevent Windows from resetting your language shortcuts I **highly recommend** to apply the solution from [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1134099/windows-10-language-bar-hot-keys-are-reseted-to-none-after-locking).

### Compatibility
Works on Windows 10 with both Microsoft and Google IME, should work on other systems too.
